"""
Anti-gaming question paraphraser for AgentTrust.

Prevents servers from memorizing test answers by generating
unique question variants for each evaluation run.

Two strategies:
1. Template-based (fast, no API): Structural transforms — reorder, synonym swap, rephrase
2. LLM-based (slower, richer): Full paraphrase via LLM while preserving semantic meaning

Template-based is default; LLM-based activates when judge LLM is available.
